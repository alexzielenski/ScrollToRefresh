{"name":"ScrollToRefresh","body":"\r\nThe First Scroll To Refresh solution using only AppKit and Public APIs!\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n================\r\nScrollToRefresh is a subclass of NSScrollView that adds a \"pull-to-refresh\" feel to the \"elastic\" area of NSScrollview. \r\n\r\n![ScrollToRefresh in action](https://github.com/alexzielenski/ScrollToRefresh/raw/master/screenshot.png \"Scroll To Refresh\")\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n================\r\n\r\n1. Set the class of your scroll view to ```EQSTRScrollView```\r\n2. Set the `-refreshBlock` of your scroll view to a block to run some code when the refresh starts.\r\n3. When you know that your processing is finished, call `-stopLoading` on the scroll view to remove the refresh view.\r\n4. PROFIT\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n================\r\nThe secret is actually knowing how scroll views work. When you scroll, the clip view offsets the origin of its `-bounds` so any subview within the clipview will scroll. It also employs a couple of other methods to check the boundaries of the document view which I override to include the refresh view to get a more natural feel.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n================\r\nScrollToRefresh is licensed under the MIT license meaning you can do whatever you want with it and I am not responsible for any trouble you get and you must include the license in whatever you use it in.\r\n\r\n\t//  ScrollToRefresh\r\n\t//\r\n\t// Copyright (C) 2011 by Alex Zielenski.\r\n\t\r\n\t// Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n\t// of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n\t// in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n\t// to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n\t// copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n\t// furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\t//\r\n\t// The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n\t// all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\t//\r\n\t// THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n\t// IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n\t// FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
